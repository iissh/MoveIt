      <h2 class="postdetail-title" >Reduce Stress With Acts of Kindness</h2>
      <p class="article-content">Scientific evidence has proven that kindness reduces stress, improves sense of well-being and reduces depression.When you focus your attention on the needs of someone else, your stress levels have been proven to go down.   Stress is a reaction to a change or a challenge.  During stress response, your heart rate increases, breathing quickens, muscles tighten, and blood pressure rises.  In the short term, stress can be helpful.  It makes you more alert and gives you energy to get things done.  But long-term stress can lead to serious health problems. Emotional stress that stays around for weeks or months can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, fatigue, depression, anxiety and even heart disease. Gallupâ€™s poll indicates that 65% of the 30-49 year age group experiences stress.  Americans aged 15-29 are right behind them with 64%, while 44% of people older than 50 reported feeling stressed out. Scientific evidence has proven that kindness reduces stress, improves sense of well-being and reduces depression.  Kindness increases serotonin and oxytocin (mood hormones) which relieves stress. </p>

      <h2 class="postdetail-title" >Everyone expects you to go straight into your field as soon as you graduate, but it's not that straight forward.</h2>
      <p class="article-content">Sick of the questioning and judgement because I'm working minnimum wage job just a year after graduating.

        If I was a lazy ass hole would I have graduated with a 1st? If I was a lazy ass hole would I be working all the hours I can get to fund my post grad next year? If I was a lazy ass hole would I have chosen a creative degree knowing the amount of passion and effort I would have to have in order to be successful in that career?
        
        People see what they want to see, they see a graduate working in a "lowly" job and they are happy because it makes them feel less insecure about their own failures.
        
        I took 4 years out of my life to study, whilst the rest of the world were saving for mortgages and working their way up in jobs, which is equally fine and dandy. I sacrificed the idea of having a decent saving account for over 20,000 in student debt in the hopes of pursuing a career I'm passionate about. And that pursuit doesn't end after graduating, most people don't just walk into grad jobs even with a high grade degree. There's voluntary work, internships and post grad study and years of working in "lowly" jobs in order to fund these next steps.
        
        There's so much pressure from people who have no idea how hard I've worked to get here and no idea how much hard work is still ahead. I'm sick of being seen as a failure because I don't meet these misguided expectations, it's driving me to depression and toxic perfectionism.</p>
